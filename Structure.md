# Structure of the Code
The code is devided into 7 files. That is:
- **Constants.py** Here, natural constants and simulation parameters can be edited.
- **Fields.py** Initial electromagnetic fields can be adjusted here.
- **ParticleDestributionValues.py** Initial macropatricle distributions can be adjusted here.
- **MaxwellSolver.py** Implementation of PSTD maxwell solver.
- **ParticlePusher.py** Implementation of Boris particle pusher.
- **FieldGather.py** J-Field deposition of charged particles as well as assigning each particle a field.
- **Main.py** Main loop.
